This work-in-progress library will make it easy to support Seq from Node.js logging libraries, initially `node-bunyan` and `structured-log`.

See `example.js` for the current API, which is still being designed. It is not expected that application users will interact with this except through logger-specific adapters.

While not ready yet for general use, all suggestions, bug reports and contributions are appreciated :-)
